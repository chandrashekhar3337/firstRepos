#ECOMMERCE
This e-commerce website project is a comprehensive platform built with HTML, CSS, and Java, designed to offer users a seamless shopping experience. The website features a dynamic and responsive front-end interface created with HTML and CSS, ensuring compatibility across devices. Java powers the back-end functionalities, handling essential processes like managing inventory, processing transactions, and ensuring secure user authentication.

With a user-friendly layout, visitors can browse product listings, view details, and add items to their cart effortlessly. This project showcases the integration of front-end and back-end technologies, demonstrating a full-stack approach to e-commerce solutions. Through this project, I focused on creating a visually appealing, functional, and secure platform that provides users with a smooth online shopping experience.
